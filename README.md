# Assignment 10 - Group Good Awareness
This assignment is based on the tutorial found here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/19/opencv-tutorial-a-guide-to-learn-opencv/
A useful practice is to install imutils, which is also used in the tutorial:

pip install imutils

Please use the image primary-shapes.jpg included in this repo.

## Question one:
Display the image and print width, height and depth of the image.

## Question two:
Resize the image. The imutils package is useful for this.

## Question three++:
Convert the image to greyscale, then show the edges found in the image.
Make a thresholding of the image, then use this thresholding for finding contours in the image.
Loop over, and display a visualization of the original image where the contours are outlined.
